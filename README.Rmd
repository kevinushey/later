# Later

Scoped side effects and signals for R.

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kevinushey/later.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kevinushey/later)

This package:

- generalizes `on.exit()` to a function `defer()`, which can attach exit
  handlers to any currently executing function, and uses that to scope side
  effects, and

- provides a simple signal / event system, using event handlers registered
  through `on()` / `off()`, and events fired through `signal()`.

## Scoped Side Effects

The `defer()` primitive generalized `on.exit()`, allowing a function to perform
cleanup work after the parent invoking function has finished.

```{r}
scope_dir <- function(dir) {
  owd <- setwd(dir)
  defer(setwd(owd), envir = parent.frame())
}
```

The `scope_dir()` function can be called to set the working directory, and
restore the working directory when the caller is done. For example:


```{r}
in_dir <- function(dir) {
  scope_dir(dir)
  print(basename(getwd()))
}
print(basename(getwd()))
in_dir("tests")
print(basename(getwd()))
```

## Signals

Register a signal handler using `on("signal", <handler>)`, and fire events with
`signal("signal", <data>)`. Useful for long-range communication between
functions / objects.

These functions are similar to builtin `R` capabilities: `signalCondition()` 
allows you to signal a condition, and `withCallingHandlers()` can be used to
register handlers for signaled conditions (alongside errors, warnings, and
otherwise). The main difference between the system in `later` and in base `R`:

1. Rather than wrapping the executing expression in `withCallingHandlers()`, you
   can just call `on()` anywhere in a function's body, and any `signal()`s fired
   later on in the program's executed will be handled by that handler,

2. A call to `signal()` can emit _any_ kind of data object; you are not limited
   to `R` conditions,

3. A registered handler for a signal won't alter control flow (ie, this signal
   system doesn't have the `restarts` mechanism that `R` uses for 'long jumps'),

4. Handlers are registered in a stack (so the most recently registered handlers
   will handle a signal first); and handlers can call `stop_propagation()` to
   ensure a signal deeper in the stack do not receive the signal.

An example to illustrate, with a set of 'workers' that can call `signal()`
when they've completed some work, and a 'manager' that listens for the
emitted signals from these workers.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
make_worker <- function(i) {
  force(i)
  function() {
    signal("work", i)
  }
}

workers <- lapply(seq_len(5), make_worker)
manager <- function() {
  
  counter <- 0
  on("work", function(data) {
    cat(sprintf("Received data: '%s'\n", data), sep = "")
    counter <<- counter + 1
  })
  
  # Run for 2 milliseconds
  time <- Sys.time()
  while (Sys.time() - time < 0.002) {
    worker <- sample(workers, 1)[[1]]
    worker()
  }
  
  cat(sprintf("Executed %s tasks.\n", counter), sep = "")
}

manager()
```
